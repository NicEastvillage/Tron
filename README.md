# Tron

A Tron game mode for Rocket League using the [RLBot framework](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot).

When enabled every car will leave a trail behind the ball and human players can collide with the trails (this among other things can be changed in settings.py). The script is not optimized and can be laggy with 3+ players. Debug rendering must be ON when using this script.
